You'll find some mods that we can't include yet below!

## Mods

[FastQuit](https://modrinth.com/mod/fastquit): (out of date)

- Butter-smooth quit for single-player people!

[Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons): (out of date, 1.19.4 < 1.20.1)

- View distance of 256 chunks or greater using LoDs!
- A 1.20.1 branch is [in-development](https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod), but it's still unstable.
   - I had a few crashes testing my own compiled version ;) 
- THIS LOOKS SO INCREDIBLE AHHHHHH I WANT IT SO BAD

### Warnings

Mods under this section have been added despite some potential problems.  

Official [Masa Mods](https://modrinth.com/modpack/kosmolot-unofficial-masa-mods/version/1.20+ksm.3): (All of them use Curseforge)

- The unofficial ports are bleeding-edge/"buggy", but are updated more quickly than Masa's own mods.
- Unofficial ones are also available on Modrinth! :)
- For now, let's use the official releases - despite Curseforge. :( 

### Blacklist

These mods won't be added for one reason or another...

- [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor): Rendered entirely obsolete by vanilla 1.20's new lighting upgrades.

## Resource Packs

Resource packs found here are most likely out of date and not working correctly yet!

[Faithless](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithless/gallery) - 1.19.3 (out of date)

- Reason: Causes a crash when switching to it on 1.20!

[Hyper Realistic Sky](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/hyper-realistic-sky) v1.8 (out of date)

- Reason: Won't install without companion Fabric mod, which is out of date!

## Shaders

Similarly, shaders found here probably don't work on our current version. Yet..!

[Pixel Perfect](https://modrinth.com/shader/pixel-perfect/gallery) - 1.2.1 (out of date)

- Reason: makes OpenGL sad
- I really can't wait for this one - it's purdy
