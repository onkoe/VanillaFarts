### Warnings

Mods under this section have been added despite some potential problems.  

Official [Masa Mods](https://modrinth.com/modpack/kosmolot-unofficial-masa-mods/version/1.20+ksm.3): (All of them use Curseforge)

- The unofficial ports are bleeding-edge/"buggy", but are updated more quickly than Masa's own mods.
- Unofficial ones are also available on Modrinth! :)
- For now, let's use the official releases - despite Curseforge. :(

### Blacklist

These mods won't be added for one reason or another...

- [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor): Rendered entirely obsolete by vanilla 1.20's new lighting upgrades.

## Resource Packs

Resource packs found here are most likely out of date and not working correctly yet!

[Faithless](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithless/gallery) - 1.19.3 (out of date)

- Reason: Causes a crash when switching to it on 1.20!

[Hyper Realistic Sky](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/hyper-realistic-sky) v1.8 (out of date)

- Reason: Won't install without companion Fabric mod, which is out of date!

## Shaders

Similarly, shaders found here probably don't work on our current version. Yet..!

[Pixel Perfect](https://modrinth.com/shader/pixel-perfect/gallery) - 1.2.1 (out of date)

- Reason: makes OpenGL sad
- I really can't wait for this one - it's purdy
