## Resource Packs

Resource packs found here are most likely out of date and not working correctly yet!

[Faithless](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithless/gallery) - 1.19.3 (out of date)

- Reason: Causes a crash when switching to it on 1.20!

[Hyper Realistic Sky](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/hyper-realistic-sky) v1.8 (out of date)

- Reason: Won't install without companion Fabric mod, which is out of date!

## Shaders

Similarly, shaders found here probably don't work on our current version. Yet..!

[Pixel Perfect](https://modrinth.com/shader/pixel-perfect/gallery) - 1.2.1 (out of date)

- Reason: makes OpenGL sad
- I really can't wait for this one - it's purdy
