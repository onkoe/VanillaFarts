You'll find some mods that we can't include yet below!

## Mods

[Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor): (out of date)

- Lighting optimizations!

[FastQuit](https://modrinth.com/mod/fastquit): (out of date)

- Butter-smooth quit for single-player people!

Official [Masa Mods](https://modrinth.com/modpack/kosmolot-unofficial-masa-mods/version/1.20+ksm.3) (out of date, all use Cf)

- The unofficial ports are bleeding-edge, but are updated more quickly than Masa's own mods.
- Unofficial ones are also available on Modrinth! :)

[Bobby](https://modrinth.com/mod/bobby) (1.19.4 < 1.20 > 1.20.1. unsupported release!)

- Currently waiting for other mods to be updated to 1.20.1, as there's no 1.20 Bobby release yet!

[Debugify](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/issues/258) (unplayable bug)

- Currently waiting on either a 1.20.1 upgrade (which will take a while) or a 1.20 backport! Status in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/issues/258)!

## Resource Packs

Resource packs found here are most likely out of date and not working correctly yet!

[Faithless](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithless/gallery) - 1.19.3 (out of date)

- Reason: Causes a crash when switching to it on 1.20!

[Hyper Realistic Sky](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/hyper-realistic-sky) v1.8 (out of date)

- Reason: Won't install without companion Fabric mod, which is out of date!

## Shaders

Similarly, shaders found here probably don't work on our current version. Yet..!

[Pixel Perfect](https://modrinth.com/shader/pixel-perfect/gallery) - 1.2.1 (out of date)

- Reason: makes OpenGL sad
- I really can't wait for this one - it's purdy
