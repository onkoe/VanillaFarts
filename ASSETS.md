# Assets

While this pack mostly intends to include mods and good defaults, it also contains some assets, like resource packs and shaders. Since these can't be updated with [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) (yet), let's keep track of them here!

If you'd like to add one to the list, you can open up an issue or send a PR. Just make sure that reuse is allowed by the author! :)

By the way, you can add older versions of resource packs or shaders by using these commands:

```bash
$ alias pa "packwiz modrinth add "
# this will save you some work

$ pa --project-id first --version-id second
# where the values are from https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/first/versions/second/file.zip
# and this link comes from right clicking a download
```
